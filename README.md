# ‚ôüÔ∏è Paint It Black! 
Paint It Black! is a dark-themed QlikSense mashup template built on ReactJS, using ECharts and LeafletJS to streamline mashup development. The code provided here can be used straight away and modified as you see fit.

# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements & Installation
This covers the install procedures of the mashup as-is, i.e. while using the two default applications _Consumer Sales_ and _Insurance Claims_.

## Installing locally for development
1. Install and run your QlikSense Desktop server normally.
2. Download and put in your `Documents/Qlik/Sense/Apps` folder the two Qlik apps: "[Consumer Sales.qvf](https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/ConsumerGoodsSales)" and "[Insurance Claims 2021.qvf](https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/InsuranceClaims)".
3. Download this repository and put it in a folder inside `Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions`. E.g.: `Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions/PaintItBlack`.
4. Open the mashup on your browser. The URL is most likely _http://localhost:4848/extensions/PaintItBlack/index.html_. If not, go to the Dev-Hub and search for the mashup there.


## Installing on a QlikSense Enterprise production server
1. Download this repository, open the `config.js` file and switch environments from 'DEV' to 'PRD'.
2. Import the [Consumer Sales](https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/ConsumerGoodsSales) and [Insurance Claims](https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/InsuranceClaims) applications to the server via QMC.
3. Again in config.js, under the prdQvfNames configuration, put the Consumer Sales and Insurance Claims application IDs as they are saved in your server.
4. Import the mashup to your server via the QMC.
5. Open the mashup via Dev-Hub or via your server's URL, with path `yourserver.xxx/extensions/PaintItBlack/index.html`
